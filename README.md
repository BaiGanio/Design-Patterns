# DesignPatterns
### Introduction: Principles must known
-	Encapsulate what varies.
-	Favor composition over inheritance.
-	Program to interfaces, not implementations.
-	Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
-	Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
-	Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.

### Getting Started
- This journey requires minimal knownladge of OOP & it's four pillars: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism & Inheritance
