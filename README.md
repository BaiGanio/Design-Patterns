# DesignPatterns
### Basics
- This project requires minimal knownladge of OOP & it's four pillars: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism & Inheritance 
### Principles
-	Encapsulate what varies.
-	Favor composition over inheritance.
-	Program to interfaces, not implementations.
-	Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
-	Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
-	Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.
